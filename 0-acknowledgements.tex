\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors, Dr. Chun Tian and Prof. Michael Norrish, for their exceptional guidance and support throughout this project. Their insightful feedback, patience, and willingness to help at every stage made this journey much smoother and more enriching. I am especially grateful for the time they dedicated to reviewing my work, offering constructive suggestions, and pushing me to think more critically about the subject matter.

A special thank you to my family for their unwavering encouragement and understanding. Their constant support and belief in my abilities have been a source of motivation during challenging times.
